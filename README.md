## About the proyect
This proyect goal is to have a telegram bot that gives updates, in real time, on Cypto prices.

To do so I use Web Scarping to obtain the updated data.

Run the folowing command in your terminal to install de dependancies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

You'll have to rename *.env.example* to just *.env* and enter you bot token.
